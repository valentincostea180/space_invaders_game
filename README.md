Designed and implemented a 2D arcade-style shooter game in MATLAB, inspired by classic "Space Invaders" gameplay. The project demonstrates proficiency in event-driven programming, graphical user interface (GUI) design, and real-time game logic handling.

Created a custom game window and interactive UI using MATLABâ€™s figure and axes functions.

Developed real-time game mechanics including player movement, shooting mechanics, and enemy behavior using timers and keyboard event callbacks.

Designed dynamic background elements (e.g., randomized starfield) and modular components such as enemy wave generation, collision detection, and score tracking.

Managed game state transitions (win/loss conditions, score updates) and resource cleanup to ensure stable execution.

Applied structured, object-like logic using nested functions to encapsulate game functionality and maintain code clarity.
